## Install Package

Before we start, make sure that the `ValleyBikes` package is installed in your computer.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("Amherst-Statistics/ValleyBikes")
```

## Load Package

To plot the stations we will use the `ValleyBikes` package. 

```{r}
library(ValleyBikes)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Plot Stations

The data is lazily loaded when it is needed. The package contains a dataframe of the stations.

```{r}
glimpse(stations)
```

Now we plot them.

```{r}
ggplot(stations, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, color = community_name)) +
    geom_point(size = 4, shape = 1, stroke = 2) +
    labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude",
         title = "Map of Valley Bike Stations",
         color = "Community")
```
